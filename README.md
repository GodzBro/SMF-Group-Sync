SMF-Group-Sync
==============

###Installation
Put 'SMF-Group-Sync-master' in your addons folder.

###Config
Configuring this script is quite easy. Just input your database's info at the top. Under that, you will see a table labeled GroupID. The ULX group name will equal the ID of the SMF group you want that ULX group to be synced with.

#####Finding SMF  Group's Group ID
To do this, on your SMF site, go to Admin > Members > Membergroups and click on the member group of which you want to find the ID. In the URL of the page, there will be a part that says group=x (ex: godzttt.com/index.php?action=admin;area=membergroups;sa=members;**group=13**). This is your SMF Group ID.
